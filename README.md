# LCS
Repo to house and test Learning Classifier Systems experiments

The goal of the initial tests is to simply familiarize ourselves with the Elementary Learning Classifier System developed by Ryan Urbanowicz and hosted at https://github.com/ryanurbs/eLCS.git and the scikit-learn version at https://github.com/UrbsLab/scikit-eLCS.

The initial implementation with simply try to follow the tutorial in "Introduction to Learning Classifier Systems" by Ryan Urbanowicz. Initial problems will be the parity problem and low n-bit multiplexer problems. Further implementations will attempt classification problems like the Titanic and MNIST data sets.
